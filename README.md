The project requires students to initiate their own inference project using Nvidia DIGITS workspace. The project builds on the initial reference project for digit image recognition inside the supplied Nvidia Digits environment.
The first part of the project is an inference project against supplied digit image recognition dataset, the second part is to build inference project from the data students collected. For more information and results please refer to [project writeup](image-classification-clothing .pdf) .
